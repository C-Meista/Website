      </div>

      <div class="section-body">
        <p>
          At <strong>Chainzz</strong>, we believe a neck chain is more than just an accessory – it’s a statement.
          Founded by <strong>Michael Senn</strong>, a passionate designer and solo entrepreneur, Chainzz was born
          from a deep appreciation for craftsmanship, minimalism, and timeless style.
        </p>

          <h3>Our Story</h3>
          <p>
            What started as a personal journey to find the <em>perfect</em> neck chain evolved into a mission:
            to create high-quality, durable, and beautifully designed chains that elevate any look – without
            the insane markups.
          </p>
          <p>
            After months of testing materials and prototypes, Michael launched Chainzz to deliver premium
            chains that blend <strong>urban edge</strong> with <strong>refined elegance</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each piece is carefully curated or designed with an obsessive focus on <strong>detail, comfort,
            and finish</strong>. Whether it’s a bold Cuban link or a sleek rope chain, we ensure that what you
            wear around your neck reflects strength, confidence, and authenticity.
          </p>
